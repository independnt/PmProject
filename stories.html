        <p class="story">I was once kidnapped by a taxi driver. No, seriously. I was going home with some friends after a long night, planning to pay with a card, because its 2018, and you would think that isn't a problem. The driver proceeds to tell us that cards are not accepted passed 1:30 am, which is bulls*it. When we tried to get out, he floored it. And drove us around at fast speeds so we couldn't jump out of the vehicle. It was a wild ride.</p><div class="story-arrow"><a><i class="ion-chevron-right"></i></a>
